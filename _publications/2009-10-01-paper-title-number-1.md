Mammalian DNA replication origins lack a genetically encoded consensus sequence, yet they fire in a non-random manner and exhibit patterns of clustering. Here, through genomic assays and computational pattern analysis, we show that cohesin-mediated loop extrusion on G1 chromatin functionally defines the genomic locations of replication initiation sites in the ensuing S phase.
